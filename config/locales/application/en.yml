# This lexicon (including subdirectories of `/config/locales/`)
# contains entries for messaging across all Components and
# Engines used in the host application. This requires that when
# Engines are used in other host applications, lexicon entries must
# be defined there, for the Engines to work. The benefits are that
# text content can be managed in one place for the entire host
# application, and implementation is simpler.
#
# Adhering to a defined schema for key nesting allows us to easily
# locate an entry, and maintain encapsulation of components. Examples:
#
# Rails namespaces
# {locale}.{namespace}.path.to.key
# 'errors.messages.generic.422'
#
# Engine-based
# {locale}.{Engine}.{filename}.{method}
# 'en.api.offers.offer_restriction_error'
#
# Method with multiple responses
# {locale}.{Engine}.{filename}.{method}.{response_code}
# 'en.api.terms_and_conditions.accept.422'
#
# See `/README.md` for more information.
